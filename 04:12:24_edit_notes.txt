1. Added .lower() to gene_name for database comparison in both designHCR3Probes and designUSeqFISHProbes. Without this step, if gene_name is not all lowercase (which is quite possible since there is no specification on the parameters), the function will fail to find any valid probes.
2. Added function HCR3IsUnique, which allows the search to happen after bad probes from basicFilter are removed in designHCR3Probes. Each inquiry to the database takes several seconds and there are often thousands of inquiries to make before the filtering. However, if this step happens after basic filtering, the number of inquiries required is often much fewer, saving tremendous time.
- I only used designHCR3Probes and am therefore unfamiliar with the detailed logic in designUSeqFISHProbes. To avoid conflicts in designUSeqFISHProbes, I kept the original IsUnique in the script.

1. Updated all usages of calcHairpin function, which is deprecated, to calc_hairpin.
2. Updated all results file names so that they include gene_name, which can avoid overwriting previously generated files when using the function on a list of genes.
3. Fixed indexing issue of generated probes in designHCR3Probes. Previously, the probe pairs are not indexed continuously, but rather in a pattern of "1, 1, 3, 3, 5, 5, ..." My suggestion, as written in lines 80 and 82, results in a pattern of "1-1, 1-2, 2-1, 2-2, ..." This way it is easier to compare sequences across different files since the original numbering is retained.
4. Added 'openpyxl' to requirements.txt.
